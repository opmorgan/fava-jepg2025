62853fe01fa0d21c4daacfcb	Not sure (please explain):	I've done a lot of random tasks where I have to press a button quickly in response to something and it's hard to remember them all, and honestly I just couldn't rule out having done this particular type of task with the big and the little shapes before, but I also couldn't necessarily say that I have done it before either, but I just don't really know.	My left arm might have been a little bit tired at the start of the task since I tend to lean on it a little bit when I use a computer, but I did try to make sure it was at rest the same as my right arm was when I did the task.
