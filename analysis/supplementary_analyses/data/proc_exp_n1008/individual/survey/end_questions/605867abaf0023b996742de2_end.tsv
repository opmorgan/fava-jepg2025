605867abaf0023b996742de2	Not sure (please explain):	I have done the test for ADHD where you are supposed to click if a certain letter pops up on the screen! I am unsure if it is relevant but wanted to include it just in case!	Fun study! The images do show up fairly small on my computer screen, so if it wouldn't effect the study, it would be nice for them to be a bit bigger :) Thank you!
