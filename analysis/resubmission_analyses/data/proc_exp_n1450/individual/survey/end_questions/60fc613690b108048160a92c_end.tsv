60fc613690b108048160a92c	No	NA	Ok a bit random but if you havent heard of it, there may be a video that could influence the results of the auditory section. It is an old CGI video of a wiener dog on a plane with a mans voice saying ""ha ba ta ka ba na"" and so forth. It was somewhat popular where I am from and all i could hear during the listening portion was that wiener dog haha.
