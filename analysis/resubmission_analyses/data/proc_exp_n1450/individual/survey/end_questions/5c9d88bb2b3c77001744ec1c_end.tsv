5c9d88bb2b3c77001744ec1c	Not sure (please explain):	I know I have done similar tasks before (recognising the shapes and recognising syllables like 'pa' 'ba' and 'ka'). But I can't remember if both tasks were in the same study like this. I also don't remember switching the same finger from 'z' to '/'. I can quite confidently say I have never done an IDENTICAL task to this in its entirety.	Just to confirm that I always use a mouse with my right hand. I don't know if that is standard for left handed people, I do most things left-handed. Also wishing you good luck and all the best with your research.
