60b8242021561f7827855c02	No	NA	The very first time I had to hit the spacebar to start the experiment, hitting the spacebar did nothing. I just started touching random keys until it initiated. I am not sure which one caused the experiment to start. After that, the spacebar always worked fine. I am not sure if it was an issue on my end or the experiment program.
