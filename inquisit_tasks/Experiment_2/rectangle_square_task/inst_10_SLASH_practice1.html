      Let's get started! Remember, press the
      <strong>"/" (slash)</strong> key with your <strong>right index finger</strong>
      whenever you see either a rectangle or a square.
      Please keep your eyes focused on the center of the screen.

      Press the spacebar to begin a practice run.
      We'll let you know whether you've responded correctly.
      Be sure to respond as quickly as possible—if you take longer than
      2 seconds to respond to a rectangle or a square,
      your response will be counted as incorrect (too slow).
